## Setting up the Hackathon environment
You will need to perform the following steps to get your environment up and configured:
If you want to go fast and test in a small chain use the following to setup a parity node:

0. [Setup of a parity dev nod](ParitySetup.md)

If you want to go big go for a consortium deployment:
1. [Deployment and configuration of Azure Ethereum Consortium Blockchain](EnvironmentSetup.md)
2. [Deployment of Ethereum Explorer Web App](ExplorerSetup.md)
3. [Setup of a developer vm and tools](DeveloperSetup.md)

## Writing your first smart contract and integrating it into an application
1. [First smart contract using Mist](HelloSmartContracts.md)
2. [Building an API for your smart contract](HelloSmartApi.md)
3. [Development and Deployment of a Smart contract using Truffle](DevSmartContract.md)
4. [Development of a DApp](Dapp.md)
5. [Deployment of your API or DApp](DeployApps.md)

Happy Hacking!
